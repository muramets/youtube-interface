/* If the dropdown is separate, we might need to adjust. 
   But based on the design, the dropdown is likely part of the scrollable area or fixed to the right?
   The previous implementation had the dropdown inside the flex container with `marginLeft: auto`.
   If we want the chips to scroll but the dropdown to stay fixed, we need to separate them.
   The user said "filter bar should scroll", usually the whole thing or just chips.
   YouTube's filter bar on Watch Page: The chips scroll. The "All/Playlist" dropdown isn't standard YouTube.
   But in our design, we have chips + dropdown.
   If we want arrows, usually it's for the chips list.
   Let's assume the dropdown should be FIXED at the end or scroll with them?
   If it scrolls, it might get hidden. 
   Let's try to keep the dropdown fixed at the right if possible, or just let it be part of the flow.
   The user's screenshot shows chips.
   Let's assume the chips scroll. The dropdown might be better fixed to the right or left?
   Actually, the previous code had `marginLeft: auto` for the dropdown.
   If we put everything in `overflow-x: auto`, `marginLeft: auto` works but you have to scroll to see it if it overflows.
   Let's separate: Scrollable Chips Area + Fixed Dropdown?
   Or just Scrollable Area containing everything.
   Given the "arrows" request, it implies a long list of chips.
   Let's make the chips scrollable and keep the dropdown fixed to the right if there's space, or just let it be part of the flow.
   Actually, standard YouTube Watch Page doesn't have a dropdown there.
   Our design has it.
   Let's put the chips in the scroll container and the dropdown outside/fixed?
   No, the user said "filter bar... should scroll".
   Let's assume the user wants the CHIPS to scroll.
   
   Let's update the CSS to support the arrow buttons.
